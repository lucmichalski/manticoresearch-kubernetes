# manticoresearch_on_kubernetes
This a semi-automated set up for manticore cluster set up on docker container-runtime  via kubernetess with the help of ansible.
Technologies needed for this set up-
            i) kubernetes
            ii) ansible
In this set up we are going to create two docker containers running manticoresearch latest service, both of which forming a cluster in which data is replicated from master to slave.
